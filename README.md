# React_Queue_App, created using ReactJS

Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type);

It is short and simple, e.g. one button that shows enqueue items to queue and another button that shows dequeue items out of queue.
